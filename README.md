Title: 1st Portfolio website attempt by Tataw C.
intent was to use a template and build with ut from scratch, adding extra flairs of interactivity along the way. 
Then host it on GitHub pages, while learning the dynamics of hosting as well.
JavaScript and some more interactivity are still to be added in the coming weeks when the repo will be reopened
